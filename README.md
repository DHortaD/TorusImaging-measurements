# TorusImaging-measurements

Contains the python scripts necessary to obtain the results from the paper ``Orbital Torus Imaging: Acceleration, density, and dark matter in the Galactic disk measured with element abundance gradients'' by Horta et al (2024).

To run this code, it is necessary to have the TorusImaging package installed, as well as JAX.
